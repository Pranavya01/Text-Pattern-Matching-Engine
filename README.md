# Text-Pattern-Matching-Engine
## Features

- Engineered a high-performance pattern matching tool implementing advanced string algorithms (KMP, Rabin–Karp, Z-algorithm) to efficiently search large-scale text inputs.

- Optimized substring search operations from O(n·m) to O(n + m) using algorithmic design, ensuring scalability across repetitive and stress-test inputs (20k+ characters).

- Designed a minimal interactive interface (JavaScript/HTML) that allows users to input text & patterns, select algorithms, and visualize matches with highlighted substrings and performance metrics.

- Validated correctness and efficiency through real-world test cases (DNA sequences, log analysis, large text corpora), achieving thousands of matches within milliseconds.

- Showcased strong problem-solving and algorithmic implementation skills by bridging core DSA concepts with practical applications, making it suitable for search engines, text editors, and analytics tools.
